# The Lone Clone

### A clone-themed game for the [Github Game-Off 2012](https://github.com/github/game-off-2012)

Make your way through 20 puzzlicious levels using only your power of cloning.

Play it [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/james_gary/theLoneClone/index.html)! It's played best on Chrome, but is a little slow on Firefox.

**Note for judges:** I'll keep updating this game at the above url, so in fairness, here is the original version of the game as submitted midnight for GGO: [Original](https://s3.amazonaws.com/james_gary/github-gameoff/theLoneClone/index.html)
